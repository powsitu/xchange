Your task is to build a web-based currency converter, using a foreign exchange rate API as a source of truth for the conversion. The requirements for this task are as follows:

- Ability to select the source and target currencies
- Ability to input the source amount
- Conversion rates must be pulled from a third-party API. We recommend using https://ratesapi.io/, but other APIs may be used as well, however the actual conversion calculation must be performed by your application (also do not use any third-party libraries for it).

Once those requirements are met, choose and implement at least one additional feature you think the application needs most at this stage.
Here are some suggested features, but feel free to work on any other you think would add the most value.

- Ability to perform multiple conversions at the same time
- Option to select a different date for the conversion rate
- Bidirectional conversion (user can input either source or target amount)
- Show historical rates evolution (e.g. with chart)
